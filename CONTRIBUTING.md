# Locale::MaybeMaketext - How to get involved

Locale::MaybeMaketext is an open project, and we are always willing to accept bug fixes,
more tests, and documentation patches. Commit bits are given out freely and
it's easy to get started!

## Get the Code

If you just want to get your feet wet and check out the code, you can do so
from the comfort of your web browser by going to the official repository on
GitHub: L<https://github.com/bairwell/Locale-MaybeMaketext/>.

However, if you know how to use git and would rather have a local copy
(because, why wouldn't you?!), then you can clone it:

    git clone git@github.com:bairwell/Locale-MaybeMaketext.git

## Just make a bug report/feature request

There's two ways you can make a bug report (shock horror!) or a feature
request - the preferred way for Bug Reports is via the CPAN Request Tracker
at L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Locale-MaybeMaketext> or
you can make your bug report or feature request as a GitHub issue at
L<https://github.com/bairwell/Locale-MaybeMaketext/issues>
